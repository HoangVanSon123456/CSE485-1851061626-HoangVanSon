                    <p>My name is Tu and I’m a Vietnamese. I am twenty years old. I live in Ha Noi city in the north of Vietnam. My family has 4 people. My sisters is older than me. My father is a teacher at a secondary school. He has worked for 35 years in the field and he is my biggest role model in life. My mother is a housewife. She is nice and she is really good at cooking. I love my family so much. I’m a generous and easy-going person but when it comes to work I’m a competitive perfectionist. I’m also an optimistic and outgoing person so I have many friends and other social relationships. I enjoy reading, writing and doing math. I decided to become a Civil Engineer because  have always been fascinated by bridges, buildings, and skyscrapers. A degree in Civil Engineering enables me to achieve my goals and also gives me an opportunity to make a difference in the community. Five years from now, I want to become a project manager of a constructions project, As a project manager, my primary goals are managing people, set budgets, and making decisions of all kinds. I also want to speak English fluently so I can work with people from different countries.</p>
